Hello folks, myself Mohit Gond I'm a 3rd year mechanical engineering undergraduate student of reputed and eminent institue of the country I.E.R.T Prayagraj.
This is a semifuntional ATM working model code written with the help of Python language under the Training internship program of Octanet services pvt. ltd.
            In this code I've included a header file of user_id where, I'm assigning the input as username from the user. 
            Furthermore, the username is associated with a password, that enables the user to perform tasks like transaction history and withdraw, deposit,                        transfer and quit. 
            I've imported json (java-script object navigation) module, that helps in refining pre-existing key-values in terms of ATM credentials.
            The Key features of this console based ATM Simulator are as follows -
              1. User Authentication
              2. Account Management
              3. Transaction History
              4. Deposits and withdrawals
              5. Fund Transfer and many more.
            The achievements of the console based ATM Simulator are as follows -
              1. Successfully implemented user authentication and session management.
              2. Ensured data security and validation to prevent unauthorized access.
              3. Created a user-friendly menu driven program for easy navigation.
              4. Demonstrated proficiency in pyhton programming and software development.
            The technology stack used here are as follows - 
              1. Language - Python
              2. Development Tools - PyCharm
              3. Version Control - Git & Github
